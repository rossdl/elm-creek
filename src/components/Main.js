          <p>We have many years of experience creating Custom Web Applications for small businesses. We have the know how to create web apps that utilize the new technology of Cloud Computing. If your custom application requires it to be published on the internet we will work with you to get this all up and running so all your potential customers will have full access.</p>
          <p>Elm Creek Consulting performs Quality Assurance in our applications in three ways. First, we unit test. This is where our developers write tests into the code itself. It is the first line of defense, but it only addresses certain potential flaws within the application. The second type of testing we do is manual testing. This involves one of our Quality Assurance specialists loading the application, and verifying that the application passes the test cases we have created. This is an important step, but one that is absolutely critical to the final quality of the product. Our final testing phase comes after the installation of the software/hardware solutions we implemented to make sure everything is setup and performing to the expectation of our customer.</p>
